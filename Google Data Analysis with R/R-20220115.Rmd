The test showed in the upper section is called YAML, A language for data that translates it so it's readable, yes, the metadata...

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The text below are just my personal learning in markdown file, since I have been used it for a while. Let me test them whether they work in Rmd.

Wow, I really appreciate the visual mode of RStudio, it works like typora and even better than that!

If echo is set to false, the code would be executed when loading.

```{r test,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```
